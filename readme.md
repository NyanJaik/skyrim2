# SKYRIM 2: THE SCROLL IS NOT YOUNG

#### Skyrim 2 is just a fun little project I'm doing in Python to practice making terminal games feel less like a terminal and more like, well... a game.

>Why the name?

Well the game itself is very Elder Scrolls-esque, and I wanted to choose something funny to emphasize that I don't take this project very seriously. Skyrim of course, is the fifth game in a series, and there are some people who somehow don't know that, so I thought it's kind of funny.

>Your code is confusing.

It's really not, once you understand why things are structured the way they are, and the use-cases of the functions.

>Can I help?

Sure. If you want to help improve the game feel free to fork it and make a pull request when you're done. If you're going to improve something though, I'd rather it be UI or game mechanic related, rather than continuing the story. Otherwise we may run into quite a few conflicts.
